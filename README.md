# MCSC
Our programming standard, which is designed to be simple and useful



MCSC means Minimalist Source Code Standard. This is used in our code, and is to be referred to when commiting to our repositories.

For your sake, MSCS has been applied, keeping this short and simple to understand, and to be bare bones. Our products will be bare bones and useful, one thing to note. 


# How It Works

MSCS follows 3 simple rules. 

1. Put only things that will be used during usage.
2. Be simple to understand
3. Aim for a wide audience to understand this
4. ADD COMMENT DOCUMENTATION!!

We use python for our products, which is to encourage people of all skills to contribute, and because it is simple to learn, and is powerful with many addons that can be utilized in development. 

If any rules need clarificatipon, rule one means, only put in things that you are sure that people are going to use/appericiate. That is for the development to not go longhorn and reset everythong because of uselessness.

Rule 2 means that the code shouldn't look all cryptic and hard to understand. That's why we chose python, anyone can learn this easily and there are a lot of big corps out there who use python. We will use other languages if required, that FOLLOW our MSCS standard. 

Rule 3 means that aim for everyone, and not just the people who work here. In our workspace, it is online, so that you can work on your schedule, and there are weekly team meetings once the team is faliliar to how we work. Instead of programming our software based our understanding, we do it from a user's perspective, and try to see what you see instead of us, which brings us to our next section.
