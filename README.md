# MCSC
Our programming standard, which is designed to be simple and useful



MCSC means Minimalist Source Code Standard. This is used in our code, and is to be referred to when commiting to our repositories.

For your sake, MSCS has been applied, keeping this short and simple to understand, and to be bare bones. Our products will be bare bones and useful, one thing to note. 


# How It Works

MSCS follows [#] simple rules. 

1. ## StreamLine
You must streamline the code before committing or releasing. 
How do we streamline code? Well...

### Remove Unused Code
You must remove any unused code, or you must add a comment next to the code on why it is not implemented (Ex. Under Development)

### Re-Write
Before thinking your way of writing code is superior to all other styles, **DON'T BE THAT PERSON**
It will only hurt to be that person, when someone utterly crushes you when they show you their _perfect_ code, following these standards. Try to find better ways to write something, if any.

### Test
Please test your code. If you send a broken, crippled, useless piece of code, we will not be very happy. Test your code every time you make a major change (Ex. Removed Code, Re-Write Code, etc.)



# Participating

We know. Why do you address participating here? It's simple! We address it here because, with this, we aren't trying to force this upon you but to make it all one so that all you need is to refer here for understanding. 

Pull requests should CLEARLY STATE WHAT YOU INTEND TO DO! Miscommunication can cause major issues! If someone asks what you mean when you open a pull request, that means you aren't clear, or they misunderstood. Clarify when needed in a way people viewing the pull request can understand, and try to be simple! 

When you are opening an issue, Follow the format:

TITLE

ISSUE

ISSUE DESCRIPTION 

WHAT WAS PREFORMED TO CAUSE THE ISSUE


This way we can see what went wrong and try to fix it. If you have a bugfix, Label it in Pull Requests in the title as [BUGFIX] at the start of the title.
Then we can approve it as fast as we can. 

That's it!
